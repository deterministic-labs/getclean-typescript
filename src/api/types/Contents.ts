/**
 * One record: one fetch or upload of one source at one moment, with a `cnt_` id, kept 48 hours after its last call and at most 30 days from its making. Its facts never change. It is the answer of `fetch_contents` and of `get_contents`, and the record inside the answers of `upload_contents` and `fetch_contents_batch`. It carries what happened; the notices to read first; when it was read; its fingerprint; the content in the formats asked, or the map of sections when the text did not fit; the facts of the source; the price.
 *
 * What is the record's and what is this answer's. The record's facts come as stored on every later answer: `outcome`, `fetched_at`, `fingerprint`, `record_scope`, `source`, `pages`, `execution`, `retention` and the fetch's model work. Each answer adds only its own: `scope`, the view it delivers; `truncated`; `formats`; its notices; `request_id`; `expires_at`. A member whose line states a condition is present only while the condition holds and absent otherwise, never `[]` or null in its place; a scalar is null only where its line says so.
 *
 * Which members each outcome carries:
 * - Delivered `whole`, `sections_only` or `matching_sections`, and every partial record: `id`, `outcome`, `notices`, `fetched_at`, `fingerprint`, `scope`, `formats`, `truncated`; the formats asked for among `markdown`, `html`, `doclang`, `blocks`, `links`, `screenshot` and `raw_html`; `sections` by its rule; `counts`, `source`, `execution`, `retention`, `run_id`, `expires_at`, `request_id`, `record_scope`; `hidden_text` and `left_out` on a web page or an HTML file; `highlights`, `summary`, `schema_values`, `schema_statuses`, `pages`, `cost` and `metadata` by their rules.
 * - Delivered `unchanged`, as the fetch answers it: the first eight, with `formats` as `[]` and `truncated` false; `source`, `execution`, `retention`, `run_id`, `expires_at`, `request_id`, `record_scope`; `cost` and `metadata` by their rules. The record holds the content, which `get_contents` answers.
 * - Failed, refused or needs a person: `id`, `outcome`, `notices`, `fetched_at`, `truncated` false, `source`, `execution`, `retention`, `run_id`, `expires_at`, `request_id`; `pages` when the page count was read and `sections` when the outline was read; `cost` and `metadata` by their rules; `cost.actual` zero.
 *
 * Which members each kind of source carries. A live page is a web page read now; an archive copy is a page read under `as_of_date`; a document is a file, read at a URL or uploaded; an HTML file is an upload read as a page.
 *
 * | Member | Present on | Not on |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `screenshot`, when asked | a live page | an archive copy, a document, an upload |
 * | `raw_html`, when asked | a live page, an archive copy | a document, an upload |
 * | `doclang`, when asked | a live page, an archive copy, an HTML file | a document that is not HTML |
 * | `hidden_text`, `left_out` | a live page, an archive copy, an HTML file | a document that is not HTML |
 * | `scope` `whole_page` | a live page, an archive copy, an HTML file | a document, which has one view |
 * | `pages`, and the page numbers and labels on blocks, sections and highlights | a document with pages; an unpaged document carries `pages` with a count by characters and no page numbers | a page |
 * | `pages.recognized`, `Block.confidence`, `Table.cell_confidences` | a document with pages that have no text layer | every other source |
 * | `Table.top_left_cell`, `Table.formula_cells` | a spreadsheet | every other source |
 * | `source.final_url`, `status_code`, `publisher`, `canonical_url`, `access_kind`, `profile` | a live page, an archive copy, a document at a URL | an upload |
 * | `source.visitor` | a live page, a document at a URL | an archive copy, an upload |
 * | `source.archive`, `archives_consulted`, `next_capture_at` | an archive copy | every other source |
 * | `source.filename`, `source.captured_at` | an upload | every other source |
 * | `source.document_digest` | a document | a page |
 * | `source.url` | every source but an upload sent without `captured_url` | |
 *
 * When a record is not delivered, `outcome.message` says what may work next, and the table under `Outcome.reason` gives it for every reason.
