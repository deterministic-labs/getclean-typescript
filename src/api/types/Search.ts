/**
 * One search record, `srch_`, kept 48 hours after its last call and at most 30 days from its making. It keeps the results and the receipt as they were, and `get_search` pages the list the search stored and never searches again or charges. It reads in one order: the outcome; the notices and the coverage gaps, read before the list; the leads in rank order with the facts of each; the counts, which describe the search and never a page; how the question was read and the request as it ran; the receipt per source; what ordered the list; how it ran; the money.
 *
 * Under `view` `compact` only these members come, each whole: `id`, `outcome`, `notices`, `coverage_gaps`, `counts`, `end_reason`, `cost`, `searched_at`, `run_id`, `expires_at`, `request_id`, `next_page_token` on a paged `get_search`, and `candidates`, each with `id`, `url`, `title`, `published_date`, `access`, `relevance_score`, `source_profile`, `fetch_cost`, `dropped_reason` on a paged item, `excerpts` holding the first excerpt only, and `contents` when fetched. Every member outside that list is optional in this schema and always present in the full view.
