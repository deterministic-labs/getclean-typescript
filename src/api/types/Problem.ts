 * An answer that is not a result: `application/problem+json`, RFC 9457, one shape for every status. Read `type` to know what happened, `who_must_act` to know who must act, and `change` or `violations` to know what to change. `type`, `title`, `detail`, `instance`, `request_id`, `who_must_act` and `retryable` are always present; `status` on a top-level problem; every other member when it applies. A problem never carries a stack trace, an internal address, a secret, another caller's data or text from a site or a source. A source's or a site's failure is never a problem: it is that item's outcome.
